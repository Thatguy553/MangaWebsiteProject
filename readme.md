<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Pretty simple, once you receive the Database from me what you need to do is put the files in the root of your htdocs folder of your web server, then go into the .env file and change the information to your own. I will provide this .env later because it totally exists and i didnt just think of it. What <i>should</i> happen when you visit your website is it will be working properly, you should be able to create series, chapters, accounts, etc.</p>

<h1>What if there is errors?</h1>

<p>Well I fucking hate servers, always different in some way from what I made the website work on. If you have my contact info, you got this from me and just contact me, duh. Otherwise open an issue and ill get back to you once I have the solution or an idea.</p>
